# handmade-react-chart

I can guarantee you that drawing chart is so so easy that you don't need any libraries.  
Therefore, for you, I created a library?!

```tsx
<RawSpline width={200} height={200} values={[250, 20, 180, 150, 230, 200]} />
```

```tsx
<SimpleDonutChart radius={100} values={[1, 2, 3]} />
```

This library is to demonstrate how simple the code can be. No need to search for clumsy plugins, with unclear code debt, anymore.

Give me 10 minutes. After that, you will be able to write your own chart library with any functionality you want.
