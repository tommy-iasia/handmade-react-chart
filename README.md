# handmade-react-chart

Creating charts often involves using third-party libraries like D3 or Rechart. However, this can lead to unnecessary complexity and lack of control over the rendering process. Drawing charts is actually one of the simplest thing to code, and anyone can learn how to do it in just 10 minutes. ðŸš€

```tsx
<RawSpline width={200} height={200} values={[250, 20, 180, 150, 230, 200]} />
```

```tsx
<SimpleDonutChart radius={100} values={[1, 2, 3]} />
```

Give me 10 minutes, and I will explain everything here. After that, you can unleash your inner Picasso!
